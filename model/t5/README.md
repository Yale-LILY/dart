We use the implementation of [Ribeiro et al., 2020](https://github.com/UKPLab/plms-graph2text) by changing their preprocessing script to fit our dataset. 

```
git clone https://github.com/UKPLab/plms-graph2text.git
```

Use `data/v1.1.1/generate_input_dart.py` in this repo for preprocessing.

Then follow the remaining instructions of their repo.
